> If the proportions in the contingency table represented probabilities,

No, the probabilities would not be indepedent because two variables are
being considered together. From the table, P(Cola | Sugar) = 0.25 and
P(Cola) = 0.25. If knowing information about one variable gives us
information about another, then they are not independent.

# 2

> Is a preference for Cola positively or negatively or not associated
> with a preference for regular sugar?

There is a negative association between a preference for cola and
regular sugar. when you comapre P(Regular Sugar) and P(Regular Sugar |
Cola), it is evident that the conditional results in a decrease in the
probability, which means it is a negativly associated relationship.

This is an example of seeing versus doing. Taking the toxic medicine may
result in more people experiecning migranes, but it does not mean that
not taking toxic treatment will increase mirganes. Therefore, we cannot
conclude anything about more more toxic treatment because we do not have
enough information.
