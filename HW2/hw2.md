## Problem 1

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or
> 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.Find the
> sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**create a list of numbers 1- 999. then use remainder division to find
which integers have 0 remainder. finally, sum the subset of numbers
identified in step 2.**

    a <- 1:999
    b <- (a %% 3 == 0) | (a %% 5 == 0)
    d <- a[b]
    sum(d)

## Problem 2

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
> previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first terms 10 will
> be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. By considering the terms in the
> Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the
> sum of the even-valued terms.

**Loop through each output to continuously add the last two digits
together. Have the function break when 4 million is reached**

    fib <- c(1, 1)
    while (fib[length(fib)] < 4000000)
      {new_fib <- fib[length(fib)] + fib[length(fib) - 1]
      fib <- c(fib, new_fib)}
    sum(fib[fib %% 2 == 0 & fib < 4000000])

## Problem 3

> The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest
> prime factor of the number 600851475143?

**loop through 600851475143 by dividing each following output by 2. If
the output is 0, continue to divide again by two. If not 0, divide by 3;
if that output is 0, continue. If not 0, divide by 5. Continue the
process stated with each prime number until a final number is reached**

    prime_factors <- function(n) {
      factors <-unique(as.numeric(factor(n)))
      return(max(factors))
    }
    prime_factors(600851475143)
